# NAME : SHAKAL PATLE

# Problem Statement 1 : 

Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

# Input
Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.
Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance

# Output
Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.

Example - Successful Transaction
Input:
30 120.00

Output:
89.50

# Problem Statement 2 :

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

# Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

# Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Example
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4
